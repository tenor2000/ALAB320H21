# ALAB320H.1.2 Fashion Blog

This project recreates a Fashion Blog page from a Design Layout Mockup (found in the ./public).

## Description

I created this webpage using React and Typescript and recreated the cokup as close as possible. One thing I couldn't replicate was the font.

## Things I learned doing this project

- Using typescript
- Using styled-components
- Using React Components

## Getting Started

### Dependencies
